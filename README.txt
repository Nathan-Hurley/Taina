Issues to work on:
1. Should have implemented the `try catch` methods into the SqlPersonData.cs file properly instead of the HomeController.cs
2. Could have renamed the SqlPersonData.cs file to SqlPersonRepository.cs
3. Could have implemented more unit tests to test more features in the application
4. Could have implemented more defensive coding techniques
